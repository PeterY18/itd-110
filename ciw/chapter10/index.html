	<h2>Exercises</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="Lab_10-1/index.htm">Exercise 1</a></li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Portability: Mobile websites are more portable than mobile apps</li>
		<li>Device Capabiliites: Apps have more capabilities than web browsers</li>
		<li>Support and upgrading: Apps are more difficult to support and update
			than websites</li>
		<li>User experience: apps have full control of user interface. Websites are
		limited. Both depend on the design.</li>
		<li>Performance: Apps have a high performance, while webdesign performance
		will depend on mobile site design and bandwidth speeds</li>
		<li>Offline browsing: Apps require internet, while HTML5 on browsers can
		slightly support it</li>
		<li>Hyperlinks: Apps can link to different areas within and outside the
			app. Websites can also link to other websites</li>
		<li>Discoverability: Apps require a strategy to succeed. Websites are found
		through search engines</li>
		<li>Distribution and market size: Apps are at the mercy of appstores. Apps
		require users to dowload which is a barrier to entry. Market size is
		limited to the number of  users on the released platform. Websites can be
		accessed by anyone</li>
		<li>Costs: some app stores charge extra for publishing, hosting, and
			certifiying</li>
		<li>Some app stores charge extra fees for publishing, hosting or
			certifiying an app. websites have no costs other than development and
			hosting</li>
		<li>Revenue: apps sales must share sales revenue with the app stores after
		other costs. Revenue is gained after development, hosting, and advertising
		costs.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Other ideas</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>simplify the design</li>
		<li>balance navigation with content</li>
		<li>divide pages into smaller portions</li>
		<li>minmize text to include only high-priority content</li>
		<li>provide quick access to more detaied content for those who want it</li>
		<li>require less text entry</li>
		<li>use radio buttons, check boxes, and drop down lists</li>
		<li>remember to use html5 autcomplete features</li>
		<li>use a short url if possible</li>
		<li>avoid pop-ups</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Navigation and Hyperlinks</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>adapt content and design to your demographic</li>
		<li>Pad the clickable area around links</li>
		<il>use easy-to-understand text labels as hyperlinks</il>
		<li>try to limit the number of links on a mobile website because each new
			page requires more time and resources</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Images and mobile design</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>proportional image resizing</li>
		<li>small screen sizes mean most things need to be resized</li>
		<li>fluid image technique means that any element does not exceed the width
		of the screen.</li>
		<li>most mobile webrowsers have support for WebGL</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Validating and testing mobile web pages</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>W3C has a mobile web stie validator called the W3C mobileOk Checker as
		a validator</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>adapts to screen sizes so that reading and navigation is easy on  all
			devices</li>
		<li>Responsive and mobile design will optimize a site for smaller screens,
		simplify navigation, and create faster load times</li>
		<li>Rendering: RD states client does comutations for resizing and
			orientation, MD is where server does optimization</li>
		<li>Coding: RD has One set of HTML and one URL will work on all devices, MD
		requires a separate domain and is limited to which client devices that can
		use it.</li>
		<li>Searches/SEO: RD, use the same domain so links boost the sites search
			rankings. MD, uses a different domain, so links do not boost the search
			ranking</li>
		<li>User Experience: Content that lives on one site with one URL is easier
		to interact with, share and link to. MD, content on a separate mobile site,
		which may diminishor duplicate some aspcets of use</li>
		<li>Maintenance: RD, content that lives on one site with one URL is easier
		to update and maintain. MD, Content is on a separate mobile site, which
		requires separate processes to update and maintain</li>
		<li>Forward compatibility: RD, more forward-compatibility. Programming may
		require few or not changes to adapt to future devices and browsers. MD,
		Next-generation mobile devices and browsers ay require a mobile site to be
		reworked in the future.</li>
