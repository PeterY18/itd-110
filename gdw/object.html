<p>The br tag is used to create a line break. It is the same as hitting
enter in rich text. The hr tag is used to create a horizontal black
line to divide the page.</p>

<p>Just a young gun with the quick fuse<br>
I was uptight, wanna let loose<br>
I was dreaming of bigger things<br>
And wanna leave my own life behind<br>
Not a yes sir, not a follower<br>
Fit the box, fit the mold<br>
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number<br>
I was lightning before the thunder<br>
<br>
Thunder, thunder<br>
Thunder, thun', thunder<br>
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder<br>
Thunder, thun', thunder<br>
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder<br>
<br>
Thunder, feel the thunder<br>
Lightning and the thunder<br>
Thunder, feel the thunder<br>
Lightning and the thunder<br>
Thunder, thunder<br>
Thunder<br>
<br>
Kids were laughing in my classes<br>
While I was scheming for the masses<br>
Who do you think you are?<br>
Dreaming 'bout being a big star<br>
They say you're basic, they say you're easy<br>
You're always riding in the back seat<br>
Now I'm smiling from the stage while<br>
Youâ€¦ <br>
