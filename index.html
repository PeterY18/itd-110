<h1>Welcome to Peter's Rant Website!</h1>
<p>
This website is where I go on rants about random tech subjects. I broke the school system and enrolled in ITD 256 Database management with no programming experience at all. The ending result? With the help of my classmates and Jeff I became a free software advocate who swears by open source for prviacy, reliability, and efficiency. Don't get me wrong, I still sometimes use propriatory software for school and ease of use with other non-privacy focused people. That's just my threat model.

<p>
I'm not sure if junping into programming was a great idea but I'm now that guy who tells people to use vim and arch, BTW I use arch. I am also the guy who troubleshoots ram and xorg when I can't fall asleep. Anyways the purpose of this website is to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript so these rants are like filler text(yes I know about lorem ipsum and I don't like it).

<h2>Here are some rant pages I wrote while learning HTML and stuff</h2>
