<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there, I'm Lisha. Welcome to my blog where I write about my love for
tapioca filled beverages and spending all my money on makeup. In addition to
sipping colorful drinks and owning an obscene amount of blush, my other hobbies
include browsing reddit, watching YouTube and poking my yellow budgie,
Lemon-bar</p>

<p>Sup. I'm Lisha's little brother. I usually go on these trips to drink bubble
tea so I will write some reviews too. I am also the one making the entire
website.
