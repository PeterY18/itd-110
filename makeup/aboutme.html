<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! Welcome to my blog where I write about my love for tapioca filled beverages and spending all my money on makeup. In addition to sipping colorful drinks and owning an obscene amount of blush, my other hobbies include browsing reddit, watching YouTube and poking my yellow budgie, Lemon-bar. </p>
