<p>Infinitea is one of my latest finds for bubble tea. I have passed and missed
it so many times. The first time I went there was great. The cafe serves bubble
tea and other food. I haven't tried their food but there is bubble tea
smoothies are <span><b>great</b></span>. I found no ice chunks and it was blended extremely
smooth.</p> 
<p>They also a great variety of toppings such as the popping boba, crystal
boba, and a variety of jellies. I highly recommend the lychee jelly. The
jellies are chewy and flavorful.</p>
<p>The cafe is clean and stylish with an acceptable amount of seats. The staff
was fine and good straws were provided. Overall, this is what bubble tea places
should strive to be.<p>
