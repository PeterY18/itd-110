    <p>I have known about Shilla Bakery for so long. It is a great cafe with
    many pastie breads. I think the cafe's bread and other dishes overshadow
    the bubble tea. I will probably do some bread reviews after I'm done with
    the bubble reviews.</p>
    <p>The bubble teas are great. They come with good boba and a variety of
    flavors. The honeydew melon flavor is the best. However, Shilla Bakery
    slides to a second place because I have found some ice chunks. Not always,
    but enough to notice it.</p>
    <p>The atmosphere Shilla Bakery provides is better than Infini-Tea. There
    is plenty of room and lots of samples! I have tried many breads and my
    favorite is the strawberry cream and jalapeno bread. I also like this
    toasted pizza looking thing that I don't know what is called.</p>
