<h1>Why Everyone Should Install Arch Once In Their Life</h1>
<p>Arch is an operating system like windows and macOS. It is a specific distrubtion under linux. It is often known for a less than friendly community and difficult installations. However, the people who are lound and unhelpful are the most vocal part of the community. If you ask enough, you will find the helpful ones. The difficult installations seems daunting but the benefits are great. Here are some other reasons to use Arch linux.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Arch is highly modular</li>
    <li>Arch has the latest bleeding edge packages</li>
    <li>Arch has access to the Arch User Repository or AUR where you can download community based builds or contribute your own.</li>
    <li>Lightweight because the only packages are the ones you have installed</li>
