<h1>Thinkpad Overview</h1>

<h2>What is a Thinkpad?</h2>
	<!-- content starts below here -->
<p>Thinkpads are laptops that were first made in 1992. In 2005, Lenovo
aquireded the Thinkpad brand. Thinkpads are buisness grade laptops that are
made to withstand time. Thinkpads have been continued to be sold around the
world. It is a black laptop with the classic Thinkpad logo, and its most
noticable feature is the trackpoint input method. Many users swear by the
trackpoint as their input method. Others just ignore it. Thinkpads are still
being sold today and the older ones can still be found on resale websites. But
why would anyone want an old Thinkpad?</p> 

<h2>Slower is Faster</h2>
<p>There are a host of reasons why people are still buying old Thinkpads. I
will mostly be talking about the x200.</p>
<table>

	<tr><td>CPU</td><td>Intel Core 2 Duo P8600 2.4 GHz</td></tr>

	<tr><td>HDD</td><td>7200 RPM 160GB</td></tr>

<p>One reason people still want an x200 is because they say it is higher
quality. People say all the time new products are lower quality than the
original or classic ones. For the x200, it is said to have better build quality
and a better keyboard. Considering these laptops still function today, it might
be true. The keyboard is most likely a better reason because it has great
tactility. The other reason is most of the components in the x200 can be easily
changed and upgraded. Also note, the x200 has no trackpad only the
trackpoint</p>
<p>Another reason people still want an x200 is because it is one of the few
laptops that can be libre booted. Libreboot is an open source BIOS to replace
the propriatory found on 99% of all other motherboards. People want libreboot
because it is free software and open source. Libreboot only works with linux
and that is okay because if you want libreboot you most likely already use
linux. So with regards to privacy, libreboot and linux are great steps to
take.</p>
<p>The final reason is another reason to do with privacy and security. The x200
has a core 2 duo processor, which for most people is just a slow processor, but
for others it is last usable cpu. First, we need to understand what the Intel
Management Engine or IME is. IME is a small processor that comes with every
modern intel cpu. The information about has never been released by intel, so
all this information is based on what users have found. This cpu cannot be
turned off and always connects to internet when available. It runs until the
battery dies. It can remotely control the machine without the user knowing
anything at all. Given this some people will not use any computer with IME.
Also AMD, has their own version called PSP so AMD laptops won't work either.
However, the x200's core 2 duo cpu has the IME encrpyted differently. So with
some software and a raspberry pi, you can remove all of the IME. The x200
laptop is the last laptop this can be done with. The x220 can have most of it
removed, but not all. Older thinkpads than the x200 can most likely remove the
IME. For example, the x60 can remove it only with software. Flashing libreboot,
linux, adding an open source wifi card, and removing the IME creates nearly
100% free and open laptop.</p>
<p>One extra reason some people buy is not because of all the other reasons,
but because these laptops can be found at low prices of $100-150. Also, the
argument slower computers are faster is based on how computers got faster but
programmers got less efficient negating the two. While the x200 is now over 10
years old, it is still alive and running.</p>
