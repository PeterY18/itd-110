<h1>Stop Using Google</h1>
<p>First off, yes you can call me a hypocrite. I still use google despite
everything I'm about to say. A quick synopsis for this post is</p>

<h2>Privacy vs. Convenience</h2>
<h3>Privacy Check</h3>
<p>Privacy these days is at risk due to mass public surveillance. Mass public
surveillance can be defined as companies or government collecting information
on a large group of common people. 99% of these common people are not
criminals or connected to anything dangerous. However, in the name of
"security" governments and companies around the world spy on their innocent
<i>civilians</i>. Google is one of these companies</p> 
<h3>Convenience</h3>
<p>After learning all of this privacy knowledge and my delve into free and open
source software I have decided to take a more balanced approach to all of this.
After all, the services Google provides are extremely convenient. With 15
gigabytes of free storage, access to the entire productivity suite, and cross
platform capabilities many people have good reason to use Google products.
However, there are many problems associated with Google that all contribute to
the balancing act of privacy vs. convenience. </p> 
<h2>Control of the Internet"</h2>
<p>I would like to start off by saying one of my pet peeves is when people call
whatever company they dislike a "monopoly." Merriam-Webster define monopoly as
"exclusive ownership through legal privilege, command of supply, or concerted 
action." It is easy to call Google a monopoly but is not. Google's browser just
happens to be more than 50% of all browsers. This could be a problem.
<h3>Chrome is a Good Browser</h3>
<p>Chrome is fast, reliable, and integrates perfectly with all of the free
software Google provides.
